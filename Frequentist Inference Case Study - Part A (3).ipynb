Frequentist inference is the process of deriving conclusions about an underlying distribution via the observation of data. In particular, you'll practice writing Python code to apply the following statistical concepts: \n",
    "* the _z_-statistic\n",
    "* the _t_-statistic\n",
    "* the difference and relationship between the two\n",
    "* the Central Limit Theorem, including its assumptions and consequences\n",

    "* the concept of a sampling distribution of a test statistic, particularly for the mean\n",

    "Above, we highlighted one result from the CLT, whereby the sampling distribution (of the mean) becomes narrower and narrower with the square root of the sample size. We remind ourselves that another result from the CLT is that _even if the underlying population distribution is not normal, the sampling distribution will tend to become normal with sufficiently large sample size_. (**Check out p. 199 of AoS if you need to revise this**). This is the key driver for us 'requiring' a certain sample size, for example you may frequently see a minimum sample size of 30 stated in many places. In reality this is simply a rule of thumb; if the underlying distribution is approximately normal then your sampling distribution will already be pretty normal, but if the underlying distribution is heavily skewed then you'd want to increase your sample size."
